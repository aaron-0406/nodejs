EVENT LOOP
//////////


# Event Queue: Contains all events that are generated by our code (functions, requests, etc.).
                These events remain in a queue that are passed one by one to the event loop.

# Event Loop: It is in charge of resolving the ultra-fast events that arrive from the Event Queue.
                In case it cannot be resolved quickly, send the event to the Thread Pool.

# Thread Pool: It is responsible for managing events asynchronously.
                Once finished, it returns it to the Event Loop. The Event Loop will see if it passes it
                to the Event Queue or not.
